# MuJoCo JavaScript Bindings

> [!CAUTION]
> **These bindings are not yet ready for general use. They have been added
> without announcement while we develop the CI we need to accept pull
> requests.**

These are the canonical JavaScript and TypeScript bindings for the MuJoCo
physics engine.

This package provides a high-level API that allows you to interact with the core
MuJoCo engine compiled into a high-performance WebAssembly (WASM) module. These
bindings are developed and maintained by Google DeepMind and are always up to
date with the latest developments in MuJoCo. For brevity, the documentation
below will often refer to “JavaScript” but the concepts apply equally to
TypeScript.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> _These bindings are still a WIP. For details, see the [Future Work](#future-work)
> section. Also note that development has primarily taken place on Linux using
> Google Chrome. If you're working on a different OS or browser, you may
> encounter some rough edges._

## Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]
> Run all the commands in this README from the top-level directory.

- To compile the [`bindings.cc`](codegen/generated/bindings.cc) file, which
  generates the `.wasm` WebAssembly file, `.js` JavaScript import, and `.d.ts`
  TypeScript declaration file, you will need Emscripten SDK version `4.0.10`.
  Later versions may work but are untested. To set up the SDK, do the
  following, you can run this anywhere but the rest of the commands in this
  README only work in the shell where you source the `emsdk_env.sh` script.

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
  ./emsdk/emsdk install 4.0.10
  ./emsdk/emsdk activate 4.0.10
  source ./emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
  ```

- To easily run the JavaScript tests and the demo application, `node` and `npm`
  are required. We recommend managing these using
  [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). There are also various JavaScript
  dependencies needed for the tests, demo, and bindings build process. These
  dependencies are expected to be located in the `wasm` folder. To install
  them and ensure they can be found by later commands, run the following:

  ```sh
  npm install --prefix ./wasm
  export PATH="$(pwd)/wasm/node_modules/.bin:$PATH"
  ```

- To modify the bindings `python3` is required because the [`bindings.cc`](codegen/generated/bindings.cc)
  file is generated by a Python script. To run the bindings generator tests,
  `absl` is required and `pytest` will be helpful. Set up a Python environment
  with these dependencies as follows:

  ```sh
  python3 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r python/build_requirements.txt
  ```

> [!TIP]
> _Emscripten is well-documented. We recommend reading the sections covering the
> [Emscripten Compiler Settings](https://emscripten.org/docs/tools_reference/settings_reference.html),
> the [Emscripten SDK](https://emscripten.org/docs/tools_reference/emsdk.html),
> and the [Embind](https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/connecting_cpp_and_javascript/embind.html)
> library. To understand the limitations and caveats related to using the
> browser as a platform, see the
> [Porting](https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/index.html#porting) section._

## User Guide

### Bindings Generation

The [`bindings.cc`](codegen/generated/bindings.cc) file is compiled to generate
to `.wasm` WebAssembly file, `.js` JavaScript import, and `.d.ts` TypeScript
declaration file. These are the files you'll use to call MuJoCo from JavaScript.
To generate them ensure the npm and Emscripten SDK prerequisites are set up and
then run the following:

```sh
emcmake cmake -B build && cmake --build build
```

This command will generate the following folders under the project root:

- `build`: contains MuJoCo compiled using Emscripten.
- `wasm/dist`: contains the WebAssembly module, `.js` and `.d.ts` files.

### Example Application

After generating the bindings you will be ready to write web applications using
MuJoCo. We have provided a basic web application that uses Three.js to render a
simple simulation, to try it run this command:

```sh
npm run dev:demo --prefix ./wasm
```

You may prefer to write your entire app in C++ and compile it using Emscripten.
If you do this, you won’t need to use these bindings, since you’ll be writing
minimal JavaScript, and the granularity of these bindings may be inappropriate
(e.g., you might want to call multiple MuJoCo functions in the C++ callback
invoked by `requestAnimationFrame`).

We have also found that a hybrid approach can be helpful, as it is often more
convenient to work with browser APIs directly in JavaScript. If you choose to
write your application in C++ and compile it using Emscripten, you may want to
copy a subset of the `EMSCRIPTEN_BINDINGS` from `bindings.cc` into your
application’s source file.

## Development

In order to change the bindings you will need to change the [`bindings.cc`](codegen/generated/bindings.cc)
file but this should not be done manually. The file is generated using the
Python scripts and template files in the [`codegen`](codegen) folder, to edit
the bindings you will need to change those files and re-generate [`bindings.cc`](codegen/generated/bindings.cc)
using this command:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=python/mujoco python3 -m wasm.codegen.update
```

The codegen scripts use MuJoCo’s Python introspect library to generate the
Embind `EMSCRIPTEN_BINDINGS` block that binds C++ functions and classes to
JavaScript. The functions and classes that are bound are wrappers around
MuJoCo's C API. These wrappers provide a convenient place to add features like
bounds checking and nice error reporting.

### Testing

1. **JavaScript API tests.**
   These verify that a wide variety of MuJoCo functions and classes work
   correctly when called from JavaScript. There are also preliminary benchmarks
   for JavaScript/C++ shared memory buffers. The enums test is special because
   it is generated by a Python script. Run the tests as follows:

   ```sh
   npm run test --prefix ./wasm
   ```

2. **Bindings generator tests.**
   These are relevant when developing or extending the bindings. The following
   command finds and runs all `test_*.py` or `*_test.py` files in the `wasm`
   folder:

   ```sh
   PYTHONPATH=python/mujoco python3 -m pytest ./wasm
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> If you add/edit an enum in MuJoCo you will need to run the following command
> to re-creates the [`enums_tests.ts`](tests/enums_tests.ts) file which checks
> that all the enums in the API are bound:
>
> ```sh
> PYTHONPATH=python/mujoco python3 -m wasm.codegen.enums_test_generator
> ```

### Debugging

We provide a “sandbox” app where you can quickly write code to run in your
browser. Write your code in the [`main.ts`](tests/sandbox/main.ts) file and use
the following command to execute it in your browser:

```sh
npm run dev:sandbox --prefix ./wasm
```

The page will be blank since the script only logs to the console output. You
can add your code at the indicated placeholder and use Chrome DevTools for
debugging. It is possible to set up a debug workflow where stack traces and
stepping through code across language boundaries work correctly. Our current
method to do this only works internally at Google, but it should be possible to
replicate the experience with open-source tooling — community suggestions are
welcome!

## Future Work

1. **Bind all useful APIs.**
   These bindings are not yet complete. While the main MuJoCo APIs (`mj_step`,
   `mj_loadXML`, etc.) are well tested, other APIs (e.g., functions from
   `mjspec.h`) remain untested in real web applications (though test code for
   the `mjspec` bindings does exist). One notable feature not yet supported in
   the WASM bindings, which has proved very useful in the Python bindings, is
   named access methods — where data distributed across multiple arrays in C can
   be conveniently accessed by name, e.g., `model.geom('mygeom')` or
   `data.joint('myjoint')`. Currently, this data must be accessed via the
   `mj_name2id` function. Adding support for these features is a high priority,
   as it affects user code written in JavaScript.

2. **Improve the developer experience.**
   There is still work to be done to improve the developer experience when
   developing the WASM bindings. The most obvious issue is that bindings
   generation is not yet fully automated. As a result, it is currently less
   convenient than we'd like to identify and apply the changes needed to update
   the bindings. The goal is to eventually automate all binding code generation
   and clearly communicate what changes are required in the WASM bindings as a
   result of C++ updates. This problem should only affect developers working on
   the MuJoCo engine in C++, not end users writing JavaScript.

3. **Improve the documentation.**
   The documentation in this README will eventually be merged into the main
   MuJoCo documentation once the bindings are complete and named access is
   implemented. We also intend to review the bindings APIs and make adjustments
   to minimize differences with the Python bindings (while respecting language
   idioms) to reduce the amount of additional documentation required.

4. **Improve the [example](#example-application).**
   We aim to provide an example application that can be easily modified and
   embedded into a paper project page (see [this example](https://kzakka.com/robopianist/)).
   This could be achieved by extending the Three.js example or by compiling the
   MuJoCo toolbox C++ code using the Emscripten toolchain. Community suggestions
   and contributions are welcome!
