"""Tests to ensure that all Mujoco functions and structs are correctly handled.

This file contains tests that verify:
- All functions defined in Mujoco's introspect module are either bound in the
  generated bindings.cc file or explicitly excluded in constants.py.
- All structs defined in Mujoco's introspect module are either bound in the
  generated bindings.cc file or explicitly skipped in SKIPPED_STRUCTS in
  constants.py.

These tests help maintain the integrity of the generated WASM bindings by
ensuring that no functions or structs are accidentally missed or incorrectly
handled during the code generation process.
