    "## Motivation and assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "The `minimize.least_squares()` function is motivated by two problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **System Identification** (sysID) problem is the main use case. SysID involves finding the parameters of a simulated model to better match the behaviour of the real system. In the notation of the previous section, this problem can be cast as a Least Squares problem with the decision variable $x$ corresponding to the model parameters one wishes to identify and the residual $r$ corresponding to the difference between measured and simulated sensor values. A full sysID tutorial with examples will be made available soon.\n",
    "- The **Inverse Kinematics** (IK) problem. In this case the decision variables are joint angles, while the residual is the pose difference between an end-effector and some desired pose. The IK problem was less central to our design choices, yet is solved very efficiently with our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This motivation led us to the following assumptions and design choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The dimension of the decision variable is small: $\\dim(x) \\lesssim 100$. While Cholesky factorization (the main cost in the QP solver) scales cubically in $\\dim(x)$, it is very fast at these sizes.\n",
    "2. The dimension of the residual vector $r$ (corresponding to the number of measured sensor values, in the sysID case) can be much larger.\n",
    "3. Since each evaluation of the residual involves rolling out the physics to obtain simulated sensor values, computing $r(x)$ is the most expensive part of the optimization.\n",
    "4. Analytic Jacobians $J = \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial x}$ are usually not available and must be obtained with **finite-differencing**.\n",
    "5. Due to the sematics of $x$, box-bounds are usually sufficient (for example, masses and friction coefficients cannot be negative, joint angles should not exceed their limits).\n",
    "6. The implementation should be efficient yet readable. The [least_squares function](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco/blob/main/python/mujoco/minimize.py) takes up ~250 lines of code.\n",

    "## Implementation notes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The residual funciton must be vectorized: besides taking a column vector $x$ and returning the residual $r(x)$, it must accept an $n\\times k$ matrix $X$, returning an $m\\times k$ matrix $R$. The vectorized format is used by the internal finite-difference implementation and can be exploited to speed up the minimization by using multi-threading inside the residual function implementation.\n",
    "1. Bounds must be `None` or fully specified for all dimensions of $x$.\n",
    "1. The `jacobian` callback can be supplied by the user and is finite-differenced otherwise. Note that this callback is not made available in the case the user knows the analytic Jacobian (this is very rare in the sysID context), but in case the user wants to implement their own multi-threaded fin-diff callback.\n",
    "1. Automatic forward/backward differencing, chosen to avoid crossing the bounds, with optional central differencing. The fin-diff epsilon `eps` is scaled by the size of the bounds, if provided.\n",
    "1. The termination criterion is based on small step size $||\\delta x|| < \\textrm{tol}$.\n",
    "1. We use the simple yet affective $\\mu$-search strategy described in [Bazaraa et-al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/0471787779). Backtracking $\\mu$-increases are *careful*, attempting to find the smallest $\\mu$ where sufficient reduction is found. $\\mu$-decreases are *aggressive*, allowing fast quadratic convergence to a local minimum.\n",

    "Forward kinematics means computing the Cartesian poses of articulated bodies, given joint angles. This computation is easy and well defined. Inverse Kinematics (IK) tries to do the opposite: Given a desired Cartesian pose of an articulated body (usually called the **end effector**), find the joint angles which put the end effector at this pose. The IK problem can easily be over or under determined:\n",
    "- Over-determined: The end effector cannot reach the desired pose at all, or can match either position or orientation, but not both.\n",
    "- Under-detemined: The articulated chain has more than the minimum required number of degrees-of-freedom (dofs), so after reaching the target there is still a free subspace (imagine rotating your eblow while your hand and shoulder are fixed).\n",

    "We adress both of these situations in our implementation below, but first mention features which are currently **not implemented**, but could be added in the future.\n",
    "1. We currently support only one end-effector and target pose. Adding mutiple targets would be straightforward.\n",
    "2. Our implementation currently does not support quaternions in the kinematic chain (ball and free joints). Adding this is possible and would require a small modification to the `least_squares` function (explicit support for non-Cartesian tangent spaces).\n",
    "3. We only give examples with simple box bounds, which in the IK context means joint range limits. In order to take into account constraints like collision avoidance, one would need to make use of MuJoCo's constraint Jacobians. Please let us know if you'd like to see an example of this.\n",

    "A common feature of the IK problem is that matching poses requires matching both positions and orientations. However, these residuals have different units. Position differences are in units of length (say, Meters), while orientation differences (log-map of a quaternion difference) are in unitless Radians. The user needs to provide a conversion factor denoting how much they \"care\" about matching orientation vs. position. Since this factor has units of length we call it `radius`, which can be thought of as the radius of a sphere around the effector frame on the surface of which angular errors are measured."
