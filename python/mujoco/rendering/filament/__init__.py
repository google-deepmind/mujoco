"""Filament rendering package for MuJoCo.

Package marker required for Python package discovery and wheel distribution.

Note:
  When using Filament materials or assets, ensure that resource providers are
  registered by importing `mujoco.experimental.studio.window` or by
  constructing `mujoco.experimental.studio.renderer.Renderer` before creating
  a Filament context. `mujoco.rendering.filament.renderer.Renderer` does not
  register them: it wraps a context the caller has already created.
