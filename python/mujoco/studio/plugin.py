"""Base classes for Studio plugins.

A plugin is an object whose methods are decorated with ``messages.handler``;
``plugin_registry.PluginRegistry`` discovers those methods and dispatches
messages to them in priority order. Plugins run on one of two endpoints:

* ``ViewerPlugin`` subclasses run on the viewer side (UI, rendering) and get
  the ``viewer_protocol.Viewer`` as ``self.viewer``.
* ``SimPlugin`` subclasses run on the simulation side (physics, control) and
  get the ``viewer_handle.ViewerHandle`` as ``self.handle``.

The launchers accept both kinds in one ``plugins`` list and route each to its
endpoint (see ``split_plugins``).

Plugins can be wired up in two ways:

* **In code:** import your plugin modules and pass instances in
  ``plugins=[...]`` to ``launch_passive.run`` (or ``launch_web`` /
  ``launch_native``), as ``viewer.py`` does for ``ViewerApp``, ``StepControl``,
  and ``SimHistory``. Plugins can then take constructor arguments and use any
  dependency of the entry point.
* **From files:** ``viewer.py --plugins=a.py,b.py`` calls ``load_plugins``,
  which imports each file and instantiates every ``ViewerPlugin`` and
  ``SimPlugin`` subclass defined in it with ``cls()``.
