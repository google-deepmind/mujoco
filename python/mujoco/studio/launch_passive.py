  The viewer runs on the rendering thread and renders the scene along with any

  Args:
    config: Viewer window configuration.
    plugins: Optional viewer and sim plugins. Include a ``SimPlugin`` that
      handles ``StepEvent`` (e.g. ``step_control.StepControl()``) to advance the
      physics and, at minimum, pace each ``sync`` call.

  Returns:
    A ViewerHandle for interacting with the viewer.
