"""Python web server for the MuJoCo Web Viewer.

This server runs on a background daemon thread with one asyncio loop on a single
public port:

  * Plain HTTP GET   serves static files (index.html, WASM, assets), /model,
                     and cached model bundles by content hash
                     (/model?crc32=...), which browsers prefetch and cache.
  * WebSocket /ui    streams the headless Studio UI to the controlling browser
                     and its input back, one Studio UI wire command per
                     WebSocket message and one frame in flight (see UiSession
                     and _UI_ACK_PREFIX).
  * WebSocket /state serves the latest-wins state payload broadcast at ~60Hz
                     (see state_payload.h) as binary frames, and session roster
                     and model prefetch updates as text frames.
  * WebSocket /drop  receives models dragged onto the page (one binary frame per
                     file, controller only; see drop_handler).

Because everything is served through one port, one firewall rule, port-forward,
or HTTPS tunnel exposes the whole viewer. The browser derives its WebSocket URLs
from the page origin so no client configuration is needed.

One browser at a time controls the interactive session (it owns the /ui
stream); later browsers are rejected from /ui with WebSocket close code
_WS_CLOSE_CONTROLLER_TAKEN and can take the controller slot once it frees up.
/state connections beyond the spectator limit are closed with close code
_WS_CLOSE_SESSION_FULL.
