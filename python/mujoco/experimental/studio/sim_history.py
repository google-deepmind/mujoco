"""Simulation history recording and scrubbing plugin.

``SimHistory`` is a sim-side plugin that records a frame after every physics
step, handles scrub requests, and broadcasts buffer metadata via
``SimHistorySnapshot``.

Viewer plugins (e.g. ``ViewerApp``) add scrubbing UI by handling
``SimHistorySnapshot`` and sending one back with the desired index. There is
no need to couple such a viewer plugin to ``SimHistory`` explicitly: the
message is the only contract between them.

  """Bidirectional snapshot carrying history-buffer state.

  The simulation owns an authoritative history buffer (``sim.SimHistory``) that
  records a frame after every physics step.  The viewer keeps a local mirror
  of the buffer's size, index, and head timestamp in ``ux_state`` so its
  scrubber widget can render a timeline, but never stores authoritative frame
  data — the displayed state always comes from the sim via ``StateSnapshot``.

  This single message type is used in both directions on separate directional
  channels, so there is no slot collision in the latest-wins SnapshotChannel:

  Viewer-to-sim (scrub request):
    The viewer sets only ``index`` (the desired history offset) and leaves
    ``size`` and ``head_time`` at their defaults.  The sim loads the requested
    frame into its own model/data, requests a pause, and the result reaches the
    viewer as the next StateSnapshot.

  Sim-to-viewer (buffer description):
    Sent whenever a frame is recorded, history is reset, or a scrub request is
    applied.  ``size``, ``index``, and ``head_time`` are populated so the viewer
    can render the scrubber timeline against the sim's authoritative index
    space.

  Attributes:
    size: Total number of frames stored in the sim's history.  Left at 0 in
      the viewer-to-sim direction (the sim ignores it).
    index: History offset in the sim's index space; 0 is the most recent
      state, negative values go further into the past.
    head_time: Simulation timestamp at the head of the history buffer
      (index 0). Left at 0.0 in the viewer-to-sim direction (the sim ignores
      it).
