"""Example of a script that owns its simulation loop without ``run_sim_loop``.

Studio normally steps and paces physics in a sim plugin (``StepControl``), and
the launchers' ``run()`` only loops over ``handle.sync()``. A script that
already has a loop of its own can keep that loop and attach the viewer to it
with ``launch(...)`` instead:

  * ``model, data = handle.sync(model, data)`` hands the handle the model this
    script built and returns the one to keep stepping: the same objects, or new
    ones when the viewer replaced the model (a file dropped on it).
  * Without ``StepControl``, ``sync()`` neither steps nor sleeps. This loop
    steps ``data`` itself, sleeps the rest of each timestep (scaled by the
    speed the viewer asked for) and skips stepping while the viewer is paused.

Here the scene is a stack of boxes that gains a box every few simulated
seconds, to show the loop swapping in a model of its own.
