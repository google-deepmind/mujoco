"""Python web server for the MuJoCo Web Viewer.

This server runs in a child process with one asyncio loop on a single public
port:

  * Plain HTTP GET   serves static files (index.html, WASM, assets), /model.mjb.
  * WebSocket /ui    serves the bridge to the headless NetImgui client, which
                     connects over loopback TCP (see headless_ui.cc).
  * WebSocket /state serves the latest-wins state payload broadcast at ~60Hz
                     (see state_payload.h) as binary frames, and session roster
                     updates as text frames.
  * WebSocket /drop  receives models dragged onto the page (one binary frame per
                     file, controller only; see drop_handler).

Because everything is served through one port, one firewall rule, port-forward,
or HTTPS tunnel exposes the whole viewer. The browser derives its WebSocket URLs
from the page origin so no client configuration is needed.

One browser at a time controls the interactive session (it owns the /ui bridge);
later browsers are rejected from /ui with WebSocket close code
_WS_CLOSE_CONTROLLER_TAKEN and can take the controller slot once it frees up.
/state connections beyond the spectator limit are closed with close code
_WS_CLOSE_SESSION_FULL.
