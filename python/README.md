This package is the canonical Python bindings for the
[MuJoCo physics engine](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco).
These bindings are developed and maintained by DeepMind, and is kept up-to-date
with the latest developments in MuJoCo itself.

The `mujoco` package provides direct access to raw MuJoCo C API functions,
structs, constants, and enumerations. Structs are provided as Python classes,
with Pythonic initialization and deletion semantics.

It is not the aim of this package to provide fully fledged
scene/environment/game authoring API, as there are already a number of existing
packages that do this well. However, this package does provide a number of
lower-level components outside of MuJoCo itself that are likely to be useful to
most users who access MuJoCo through Python. For example, the `egl`, `glfw`, and
`osmesa` subpackages contain utilities for setting up OpenGL rendering contexts.

## Installation

### PyPI (Recommended)

The recommended way to install this package is via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mujoco/):

```sh
pip install mujoco
```

A copy of the MuJoCo library is provided as part of the package and does **not**
need to be downloaded or installed separately.

### Source

**IMPORTANT:** Building from source is only necessary if you are modifying the
Python bindings (or are trying to run on exceptionally old Linux systems).
If that's not the case, then we recommend installing the prebuilt binaries from
PyPI.

1. Make sure you have CMake and a C++17 compiler installed.

1. Download the [latest binary release](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco/releases)
   from GitHub. On macOS, the download corresponds to a DMG file from which you
   can drag `MuJoCo.app` into your `/Applications` folder.

1. Clone the entire `mujoco` repository from GitHub and `cd` into the python
   directory.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco.git
   cd mujoco/python
   ```

1. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv /tmp/mujoco
   source /tmp/mujoco/bin/activate
   ```

1. Generate a [source distribution](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Source-Distribution-or-sdist)
   tarball with the `make_sdist.sh` script.

   ```bash
   cd python
   bash make_sdist.sh
   ```

   The `make_sdist.sh` script generates additional C++ header files that are
   needed to build the bindings, and also pulls in required files from elsewhere
   in the repository outside the `python` directory into the sdist. Upon
   completion, the script will create a `dist` directory with a
   `mujoco-x.y.z.tar.gz` file (where `x.y.z` is the version number).

1. Use the generated source distribution to build and install the bindings.
   You'll need to specify the path to the MuJoCo library you downloaded earlier
   in the `MUJOCO_PATH` environment variable.

   **Note**: For macOS, this can be the path to a directory that contains the
   `mujoco.framework`. In particular, you can set
   `MUJOCO_PATH=/Applications/MuJoCo.app` if you installed MuJoCo as suggested
   in step 1.

   ```bash
   cd dist
   MUJOCO_PATH=/PATH/TO/MUJOCO pip install mujoco-x.y.z.tar.gz
   ```

The Python bindings should now be installed! To check that they've been
successfully installed, `cd` outside of the `mujoco` directory and run
`python -c "import mujoco"`.

## Usage

Once installed, the package can be imported via `import mujoco`. Please consult
our [documentation](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python.html) for
further detail on the package's API.

We recommend going through the tutorial notebook which covers the basics of
MuJoCo using Python:
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/mujoco/blob/main/python/tutorial.ipynb)

## Versioning

The `major.minor.micro` portion of the version number matches the version of
MuJoCo that the bindings provide. Optionally, if we release updates to the
Python bindings themselves that target the same version of MuJoCo, a `.postN`
suffix is added, for example `2.1.2.post2` represents the second update to the
bindings for MuJoCo 2.1.2.
