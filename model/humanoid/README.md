# Humanoid

This simplified humanoid model, introduced in [1], is designed for bipedal locomotion
behaviours. While several variants of it exist in the wild, this version is based on the model
in the DeepMind Control Suite [2], which has fairly realistic actuator gains.

* Degrees of Freedom: 27
* Actuators: 21
