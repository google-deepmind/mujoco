Version 2.1.1 (Dec. 16, 2021)
-----------------------------

API changes
^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Added ``mj_printFormattedModel``, which accepts a format string for floating point numbers, for example to increase
   precision.
#. Added ``mj_versionString``, which returns human-readable string that represents the version of the MuJoCo binary.
#. Converted leading underscores to trailing underscores in private instances of API struct definitions, to conform to
   reserved identifier directive, see
   `C standard: Section 7.1.3 <http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf>`__.

   .. attention::
      This is a minor breaking change. Code which references private instances will break. To fix, replace leading
      underscores with trailing underscores, e.g. ``_mjModel`` |rarr| ``mjModel_``.

General
^^^^^^^

4. Safer string handling: replaced ``strcat``, ``strcpy``, and ``sprintf`` with ``strncat``, ``strncpy``, and
   ``snprintf`` respectively.
#. Changed indentation from 4 spaces to 2 spaces, K&R bracing style, added braces to one-line conditionals.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

6. Fixed reading from uninitialized memory in PGS solver.
#. Computed capsule inertias are now exact. Until this change, capsule masses and inertias computed by the
   :ref:`compiler <compiler>`'s :at:`inertiafromgeom` mechanism were approximated by a cylinder, formed by the
   capsule's cylindrical middle section, extended on both ends by half the capsule radius. Capsule inertias are now
   computed with the `Parallel Axis theorem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_axis_theorem>`_, applied to the two
   hemispherical end-caps.

   .. attention::
      This is a minor breaking change. Simulation of a model with automatically-computed capsule inertias will be
      numerically different, leading to, for example, breakage of golden-value tests.
#. Fixed bug related to :ref:`force <sensor-force>` and :ref:`torque <sensor-torque>` sensors. Until this change, forces
   and torques reported by F/T sensors ignored out-of-tree constraint wrenches except those produced by contacts. Force
   and torque sensors now correctly take into account the effects of :ref:`connect <equality-connect>` and
   :ref:`weld <equality-weld>` constraints.

   .. note::
      Forces generated by :ref:`spatial tendons <spatial>` which are outside the kinematic tree (i.e. between bodies
      which have no ancestral relationship) are still not taken into account by force and torque sensors. This remains a
      future work item.

Code samples
^^^^^^^^^^^^

9. ``testspeed``: Added injection of pseudo-random control noise, turned on by default. This is to avoid settling into
   some fixed contact configuration and providing an unrealistic timing measure.
#. ``simulate``:

   a. Added slower-than-real-time functionality, which is controlled via the '+' and '-' keys.
   #. Added sliders for injecting Brownian noise into the controls.
   #. Added "Print Camera" button to print an MJCF clause with the pose of the current camera.
   #. The camera pose is not reset when reloading the same model file.

Updated dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

11. ``TinyXML`` was replaced with ``TinyXML2`` 6.2.0.
#. ``qhull`` was upgraded to version 8.0.2.
#. ``libCCD`` was upgraded to version 1.4.
#. On Linux, ``libstdc++`` was replaced with ``libc++``.

Binary build
^^^^^^^^^^^^

15. MacOS packaging. We now ship Universal binaries that natively support both Apple Silicon and Intel CPUs.

    a. MuJoCo library is now packaged as a
       `Framework Bundle <https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFrameworks/Concepts/FrameworkAnatomy.html>`_,
       allowing it to be incorporated more easily into Xcode projects (including Swift projects). Developers are
       encouraged to compile and link against MuJoCo using the ``-framework mujoco`` flag, however all header files and
       the ``libmujoco.2.1.1.dylib`` library can still be directly accessed inside the framework.
    #. Sample applications are now packaged into an Application Bundle called ``MuJoCo.app``. When launched via GUI,
       the bundle launches the ``simulate`` executable. Other precompiled sample programs are shipped inside that bundle
       (in ``MuJoCo.app/Contents/MacOS``) and can be launched via command line.
    #. Binaries are now signed and the disk image is notarized.

#. Windows binaries and libraries are now signed.
#. Link-time optimization is enabled on Linux and macOS, leading to an average of \~20% speedup when benchmarked on
   three test models (``cloth.xml``, ``humanoid.xml``, and ``humanoid100.xml``).
#. Linux binaries are now built with LLVM/Clang instead of GCC.
#. An AArch64 (aka ARM64) Linux build is also provided.
#. Private symbols are no longer stripped from shared libraries on Linux and MacOS.

Sample models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
21. Clean-up of the ``model/`` directory.

    a. Rearranged into subdirectories which include all dependencies.
    #. Added descriptions in XML comments, cleaned up XMLs.
    #. Deleted some composite models: ``grid1``, ``grid1pin``, ``grid2``, ``softcylinder``, ``softellipsoid``.

#. Added descriptive animations in ``docs/images/models/`` :

|humanoid|   |particle|


Version 2.1.0 (Oct. 18, 2021)
-----------------------------

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Keyframes now have ``mocap_pos`` and ``mocap_quat`` fields (mpos and quat attributes in the XML) allowing mocap
   poses to be stored in keyframes.
2. New utility functions: ``mju_insertionSortInt`` (integer insertion sort) and ``mju_sigmoid`` (constructing a
   sigmoid from two half-quadratics).

General
^^^^^^^

3. The pre-allocated sizes in the virtual file system (VFS) increased to 2000 and 1000, to allow for larger projects.
#. The C structs in the ``mjuiItem`` union are now named, for compatibility.
#. Fixed: ``mjcb_contactfilter`` type is ``mjfConFilt`` (was ``mjfGeneric``).
#. Fixed: The array of sensors in ``mjCModel`` was not cleared.
#. Cleaned up cross-platform code (internal changes, not visible via the API).
#. Fixed a bug in parsing of XML ``texcoord`` data (related to number of vertices).
#. Fixed a bug in `simulate.cc <https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco/blob/main/sample/simulate.cc>`_ related to ``nkey``
   (the number of keyframes).
#. Accelerated collision detection in the presence of large numbers of non-colliding geoms (with ``contype==0 and
   conaffinity==0``).

UI
^^

11. Figure selection type changed from ``int`` to ``float``.
#. Figures now show data coordinates, when selection and highlight are enabled.
#. Changed ``mjMAXUIMULTI`` to 35, ``mjMAXUITEXT`` to 300, ``mjMAXUIRECT`` to 25.
#. Added collapsable sub-sections, implemented as separators with state: ``mjSEPCLOSED`` collapsed, ``mjSEPCLOSED+1``
   expanded.
#. Added ``mjITEM_RADIOLINE`` item type.
#. Added function ``mjui_addToSection`` to simplify UI section construction.
#. Added subplot titles to ``mjvFigure``.

Rendering
^^^^^^^^^

18. ``render_gl2`` guards against non-finite floating point data in the axis range computation.
#. ``render_gl2`` draws lines from back to front for better visibility.
#. Added function ``mjr_label`` (for text labels).
#. ``mjr_render`` exits immediately if ``ngeom==0``, to avoid errors from uninitialized scenes (e.g. ``frustrum==0``).
#. Added scissor box in ``mjr_render``, so we don't clear the entire window at every frame.


License manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

23. Removed the entire license manager. The functions ``mj_activate`` and ``mj_deactivate`` are still there for
    backward compabitibily, but now they do nothing and it is no longer necessary to call them.
#. Removed the remote license certificate functions ``mj_certXXX``.
