.. _MJW_install:

Installation
============

The beta version of MuJoCo Warp is installed from GitHub. Please note that the beta version of MuJoCo Warp does not
support all versions of MuJoCo, Warp, CUDA, NVIDIA drivers, etc.

.. code-block:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_warp.git
    cd mujoco_warp
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install uv
    uv pip install -e .[dev,cuda]

Test the Installation

.. code-block:: shell

    pytest

.. _MJW_Usage:

Basic Usage
===========

Once installed, the package can be imported via ``import mujoco_warp as mjw``. Structs, functions, and enums are
available directly from the top-level :mod:`mjw <mujoco_warp>` module.

Structs
-------
Before running MJWarp functions on an NVIDIA GPU, structs must be copied onto the device via
:func:`mjw.put_model <mujoco_warp.put_model>` and :func:`mjw.make_data <mujoco_warp.make_data>` or
:func:`mjw.put_data <mujoco_warp.put_data>` functions. Placing an :ref:`mjModel` on device yields an
:class:`mjw.Model <mujoco_warp.Model>`. Placing an :ref:`mjData` on device yields an
:class:`mjw.Data <mujoco_warp.Data>`.

.. code-block:: python

  mjm = mujoco.MjModel.from_xml_string("...")
  mjd = mujoco.MjData(mjm)
  m = mjw.put_model(mjm)
  d = mjw.put_data(mjm, mjd)

These MJWarp variants mirror their MuJoCo counterparts but have a few key differences:

#. :class:`mjw.Model <mujoco_warp.Model>` and :class:`mjw.Data <mujoco_warp.Data>` contain Warp arrays that are copied
   onto device.
#. Some fields are missing from :class:`mjw.Model <mujoco_warp.Model>` and :class:`mjw.Data <mujoco_warp.Data>` for
   features that are unsupported.

Batch sizes
-----------

MJWarp is optimized for parallel simulation. A batch of simulations can be specified with three parameters:

- :attr:`nworld <mujoco_warp.Data.nworld>`: Number of worlds to simulate.
- _`nconmax`: Expected number of contacts per world. The maximum number of contacts for all worlds is
  ``nconmax * nworld``.
- _`naconmax`: Alternative to `nconmax`_, maximum number of contacts over all worlds. If `nconmax`_ and `naconmax`_ are
  both set and ``nworld * nconmax != naconmax`` an error will be raised.
- _`njmax`: Maximum number of constraints per world.

.. admonition:: Semantic difference for `nconmax`_ and `njmax`_.
  :class: note

  It is possible for the number of contacts per world to exceed `nconmax`_ if the total number of contacts for all
  worlds does not exceed ``nworld x nconmax``. However, the number of constraints per world is strictly limited by
  `njmax`_.

Functions
---------

MuJoCo functions are exposed as MJWarp functions of the same name, but following
`PEP 8 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/>`__-compliant names. Most of the :ref:`main simulation <Mainsimulation>` and
some of the :ref:`sub-components <Subcomponents>` for forward simulation are available from the top-level
:mod:`mjw <mujoco_warp>` module.

Minimal example
---------------

.. code-block:: python

   # Throw a ball at 100 different velocities.

   import mujoco
   import mujoco_warp as mjw
   import warp as wp

   _MJCF=r"""
   <mujoco>
     <worldbody>
       <body>
         <freejoint/>
         <geom size=".15" mass="1" type="sphere"/>
       </body>
     </worldbody>
   </mujoco>
   """

   mjm = mujoco.MjModel.from_xml_string(_MJCF)
   m = mjw.put_model(mjm)
   d = mjw.make_data(mjm, nworld=100)

   # initialize velocities
   wp.copy(d.qvel, wp.array([[float(i) / 100, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] for i in range(100)], dtype=float))

   # simulate physics
   mjw.step(m, d)

   print(f'qpos:\n{d.qpos.numpy()}')

Performance Tuning
==================

The following are considerations for optimizing the performance of MJWarp.

.. _mjwGC:

Graph capture
-------------

MJWarp functions, for example :func:`mjw.step <mujoco_warp.step>`, often comprise a collection of kernel launches. Warp
will launch these kernels individually if the function is called directly. To improve performance, especially if the
function will be called multiple times, it is recommended to capture the operations that comprise the function as a CUDA
graph

.. code-block:: python

  with wp.ScopedCapture() as capture:
    mjw.step(m, d)

The graph can then be launched or re-launched

.. code-block:: python

  wp.capture_launch(capture.graph)

and will typically be significantly faster compared to calling the function directly. Please see the
`Warp Graph API reference <https://nvidia.github.io/warp/modules/runtime.html#graph-api-reference>`__ for details.

Batch sizes
-----------

The maximum numbers of contacts and constraints, `nconmax`_ / `naconmax`_ and `njmax`_ respectively, are specified when
creating :class:`mjw.Data <mujoco_warp.Data>` with :func:`mjw.make_data <mujoco_warp.make_data>` or
:func:`mjw.put_data <mujoco_warp.put_data>`. Memory and computation scales with the values of these parameters. For best
performance, the values of these parameters should be set as small as possible while ensuring the simulation does not
exceed these limits.

It is expected that good values for these limits will be environment specific. In practice, selecting good values
typically involves trial-and-error. :func:`mjwarp-testspeed <mujoco_warp.testspeed>` with the flag `--measure_alloc` for
printing the number of contacts and constraints at each simulation step and interacting with the simulation via
:func:`mjwarp-viewer <mujoco_warp.viewer>` and checking for overflow errors can both be useful techniques for
iteratively testing values for these parameters.

Solver iterations
-----------------

MuJoCo's default solver settings for the maximum numbers of :ref:`solver iterations<option-iterations>` and
:ref:`linesearch iterations<option-ls_iterations>` are expected to provide reasonable performance. Reducing MJWarp's
settings :attr:`Option.iterations <mujoco_warp.Option.iterations>` and/or
:attr:`Optiona.ls_iterations <mujoco_warp.Option.ls_iterations>` limits may improve performance and should be secondary
considerations after tuning `nconmax`_ / `naconmax`_ and `njmax`_.

Reducing these limits too much may prevent the constraint solver from converging and can lead to inaccurate or unstable
simulation.

.. admonition:: Impact on Performance: MJX (JAX) and MJWarp
  :class: note

  In :ref:`MJX<mjx>` these solver parameters are key for controlling simulation performance. With MJWarp, in contrast,
  once all worlds have converged the solver can early exit and avoid unnecessary computation. As a result, the values
  of these settings have comparatively less impact on performance.

Contact sensor matching
-----------------------

Scenes that include :ref:`contact sensors<sensor-contact>` have a parameter that specifies the maximum number of matched
contacts per sensor :attr:`Option.contact_sensor_max_match <mujoco_warp.Option.contact_sensor_max_match>`. For best
performance, the value of this parameter should be as small as possible while ensuring the simulation does not exceed
the limit. Matched contacts that exceed this limit will be ignored.

Similar to the maximum numbers of contacts and constraints, a good value for this setting is expected to be environment
specific. :func:`mjwarp-testspeed <mujoco_warp.testspeed>` and :func:`mjwarp-viewer <mujoco_warp.viewer>` may be useful
for tuning the value of this parameter.

Parallel linesearch
-------------------

In addition to the constraint solver's iterative linesearch, MJWarp provides a parallel linesearch routine that
evaluates a set of step sizes in parallel and selects the best one. The step sizes are spaced logarithmically from
:attr:`Model.opt.ls_parallel_min_step <mujoco_warp.Option.ls_parallel_min_step>` to 1 and the number of step sizes to
evaluate is set via :attr:`Model.opt.ls_iterations <mujoco_warp.Option.ls_iterations>`.

In some cases the parallel routine may provide improved performance compared to the constraint solver's default
iterative linesearch.

To enable this routine set ``Model.opt.ls_parallel=True`` or add a custom numeric field to the XML

.. code-block:: xml

   <custom>
     <numeric name="ls_parallel" data="1"/>
   </custom>

.. admonition:: Experimental feature
  :class: note

  The parallel linesearch is currently an experimental feature.

Batched :class:`Model <mujoco_warp.Model>` Fields
=================================================

To enable batched simulation with different model parameter values, many :class:`mjw.Model <mujoco_warp.Model>` fields
have a leading batch dimension. By default, the leading dimension is 1 (i.e., ``field.shape[0] == 1``) and the same
value(s) will be applied to all worlds. It is possible to override one of these fields with a ``wp.array`` that has a
leading dimension greater than one. This field will be indexed with a modulo operation of the world id and batch
dimension: ``field[worldid % field.shape[0]]``. Importantly, the field shape should be overridden prior to
:ref:`graph capture <mjwGC>` (i.e., ``wp.ScopedCapture``)

.. code-block:: python

   # override shape and values
   m.dof_damping = wp.array([[0.1], [0.2]], dtype=float)

   with wp.ScopedCapture() as capture:
     mjw.step(m, d)

It is possible to override the field shape and set the field values after graph capture

.. code-block:: python

   # override shape
   m.dof_damping = wp.empty((2, 1), dtype=float)

   with wp.ScopedCapture() as capture:
     mjw.step(m, d)

   # set batched values
   dof_damping_batch = wp.array([[0.1], [0.2]], dtype=float)
   wp.copy(m.dof_damping, dof_damping_batch)  # m.dof = dof_damping_batch will not update the captured graph

.. admonition:: Heterogeneous worlds
   :class: note

   Heterogeneous worlds, for example: per-world meshes or number of degrees of freedom, are not currently available.
