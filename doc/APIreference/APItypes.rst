=====
Types
=====

MuJoCo defines a large number of types:

- Two :ref:`primitive types<tyPrimitive>`.
- :ref:`C enum types<tyEnums>` used to define categorical values. These can be classified as:

  - Enums used in :ref:`mjModel<tyModelEnums>`.
  - Enums used in :ref:`mjData<tyDataEnums>`.
  - Abstract :ref:`visualization enums<tyVisEnums>`.
  - Enums used by the :ref:`openGL renderer<tyRenderEnums>`.
  - Enums used by the :ref:`mjUI<tyUIEnums>` user interface package.

  Note that the API does not use these enum types directly. Instead it uses ints, and the documentation/comments state
  that certain ints correspond to certain enum types. This is because we want the API to be compiler-independent, and
  the C standard does not dictate how many bytes must be used to represent an enum type. Nevertheless, for improved
  readiblity, we recommend using these types when calling API functions which take them as arguments.

- :ref:`C struct types<tyStructure>`. These can be classified as:

  - Main structs:

    - :ref:`mjModel`.
    - :ref:`mjOption` (embedded in :ref:`mjModel`).
    - :ref:`mjData`.

  - :ref:`Auxillary struct types<tyAuxStructure>`, also used by the engine.
  - Structs for collecting :ref:`simulation statistics<tyStatStructure>`.
  - Structs for :ref:`abstract visualization<tyVisStructure>`.
  - Structs used by the :ref:`openGL renderer<tyRenderStructure>`.
  - Structs used by the :ref:`UI framework<tyUIStructure>`.
  - Structs used by :ref:`engine plugins<tyPluginStructure>`.

- Several :ref:`tyFunction` for user-defined callbacks.
- :ref:`tyNotes` regarding specific data structures that require detailed description.



.. _tyPrimitive:

Primitive types
---------------

The two types below are defined in `mjtnum.h <https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco/blob/main/include/mujoco/mjtnum.h>`_.


.. _mjtNum:

mjtNum
^^^^^^

This is the floating-point type used throughout the simulator. If the symbol ``mjUSEDOUBLE`` is defined in
``mjmodel.h``, this type is defined as ``double``, otherwise it is defined as ``float``. Currently only the
double-precision version of MuJoCo is distributed, although the entire code base works with single-precision as well.
We may release the single-precision version in the future for efficiency reasons, but the double-precision version
will always be available. Thus it is safe to write user code assuming double precision. However, our preference is to
write code that works with either single or double precision. To this end we provide math utility functions that are
always defined with the correct floating-point type.

Note that changing ``mjUSEDOUBLE`` in ``mjtnum.h`` will not change how the library was compiled, and instead will
result in numerous link errors. In general, the header files distributed with precompiled MuJoCo should never be
changed by the user.

.. code-block:: C

   #ifdef mjUSEDOUBLE
       typedef double mjtNum;
   #else
       typedef float mjtNum;
   #endif


.. _mjtByte:

.. _tyNotes:

Notes
-----

This section contains miscellaneous notes regarding data-structure conventions in MuJoCo struct types.


.. _tyNotesCom:

c-frame variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`mjData` contains two arrays with the ``c`` prefix, which are used for internal calculations: ``cdof`` and
``cinert``, both computed by :ref:`mj_comPos`. The ``c`` prefix means that quantities are with respect to the "c-frame",
a frame at the center-of-mass of the local kinematic subtree (``mjData.subtree_com``), oriented like the world frame.
This choice increases the precision of kinematic computations for mechanisms that are distant from the global origin.

``cdof``:
  These 6D motion vectors (3 rotation, 3 translation) describe the instantaneous axis of a degree-of-freedom and are
  used by all Jacobian functions. The minimal computation required for analytic Jacobians is :ref:`mj_kinematics`
  followed by :ref:`mj_comPos`.

``cinert``:
  These 10-vectors describe the inertial properties of a body in the c-frame and are used by the Composite Rigid Body
  algorithm (:ref:`mj_crb`). The 10 numbers are packed arrays of lengths (6, 3, 1) with semantics:

  ``cinert[0-5]``: Upper triangle of the body's inertia matrix.

  ``cinert[6-8]``: Body mass multiplied by the body CoM's offset from the c-frame origin.

  ``cinert[9]``: Body mass.

Convex hulls
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The convex hull descriptors are stored in :ref:`mjModel`:

.. code-block:: C

   int*      mesh_graphadr;     // graph data address; -1: no graph      (nmesh x 1)
   int*      mesh_graph;        // convex graph data                     (nmeshgraph x 1)

If mesh ``N`` has a convex hull stored in :ref:`mjModel` (which is optional), then ``m->mesh_graphadr[N]`` is the offset
of mesh ``N``'s convex hull data in ``m->mesh_graph``. The convex hull data for each mesh is a record with the following
format:

.. code-block:: C

   int numvert;
   int numface;
   int vert_edgeadr[numvert];
   int vert_globalid[numvert];
   int edge_localid[numvert+3*numface];
   int face_globalid[3*numface];

Note that the convex hull contains a subset of the vertices of the full mesh. We use the nomenclature ``globalid`` to
refer to vertex indices in the full mesh, and ``localid`` to refer to vertex indices in the convex hull. The meaning of
the fields is as follows:

``numvert``
   Number of vertices in the convex hull.

``numface``
   Number of faces in the convex hull.

``vert_edgeadr[numvert]``
   For each vertex in the convex hull, this is the offset of the edge record for that vertex in edge_localid.

``vert_globalid[numvert]``
   For each vertex in the convex hull, this is the corresponding vertex index in the full mesh

``edge_localid[numvert+3*numface]``
   This contains a sequence of edge records, one for each vertex in the convex hull. Each edge record is an array of
   vertex indices (in localid format) terminated with -1. For example, say the record for vertex 7 is: 3, 4, 5, 9, -1.
   This means that vertex 7 belongs to 4 edges, and the other ends of these edges are vertices 3, 4, 5, 9. In this way
   every edge is represented twice, in the edge records of its two vertices. Note that for a closed triangular mesh
   (such as the convex hulls used here), the number of edges is ``3*numface/2``. Thus when each edge is represented
   twice, we have ``3*numface edges``. And since we are using the separator -1 at the end of each edge record (one
   separator per vertex), the length of ``edge_localid`` is ``numvert+3*numface``.

``face_globalid[3*numface]``
   For each face of the convex hull, this contains the indices of the three vertices in the full mesh
