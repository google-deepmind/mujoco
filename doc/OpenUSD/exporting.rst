Exporting
=========

.. WARNING:: OpenUSD support is currently experimental and subject to frequent change.

Currently, exporting MuJoCo scenes to OpenUSD format is an area of active development. The primary method for exporting
is expected to be through the Python API.

USDExporter
-----------

At the moment the only way to export USD from MuJoCo is to use the existing USDExporter in :doc:`../python`.

We are working on native support for writing simulations as animations to existing USD scenes, please check back here
for updates.
