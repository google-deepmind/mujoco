Exporting
=========

.. WARNING:: OpenUSD support is currently experimental and subject to frequent change.

Currently, exporting MuJoCo scenes to OpenUSD format is an area of active development. The primary method for exporting
is expected to be through the Python API.

USDExporter
-----------

At the moment the only way to export USD from MuJoCo is to use the existing USDExporter in :doc:`../python`.

We are working on native support for writing simulations as animations to existing USD scenes, please check back here
for updates.

mujoco-usd-converter
--------------------

To convert existing MJCF assets to USD following strong authoring guidelines we recommend the `Newton
mujoco-usd-converter <https://github.com/newton-physics/mujoco-usd-converter>`__. These assets will have no reference to
the original MJCF assets but will use the :doc:`mjcPhysics <mjcPhysics>` schemas to enable faithful representation of
the source assets.

When opened, these assets should be similar to the ones generated by the :doc:`MJCF file format plugin
<mjcf_file_format_plugin>`, but there will not be any runtime overhead from converting MJCF to USD.
