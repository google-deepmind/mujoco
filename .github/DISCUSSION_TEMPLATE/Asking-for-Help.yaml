        If you encountered the issue in a complex model, please simplify it as much as possible (while still reproducing the issue).

        Model:
        <details>
        <summary>minimal XML</summary>

        ```XML

        <mujoco>
          <worldbody>
            <light pos="0 0 1"/>
            <geom type="sphere" size="1" rgba="1 0 0 1"/>
          </worldbody>
        </mujoco>

        ```
        </details>

        Code:
        ```python
        import mujoco
        import mediapy as media
        model = mujoco.MjModel.from_xml_string(xml)
        data = mujoco.MjData(model)

        with mujoco.Renderer(model) as renderer:
          mujoco.mj_forward(model, data)
          renderer.update_scene(data)

          media.show_image(renderer.render())
        ```
