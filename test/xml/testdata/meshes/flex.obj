# Faces (f)
# A cube has 6 faces. Each face is a quad, defined by 4 vertices.
# The vertices are numbered according to their order of appearance above, starting from 1.
# The order defines the face normal (front-facing) based on the right-hand rule.

# Back Face (v1, v2, v3, v4)
f 1 2 3 4

# Right Face (v2, v6, v7, v3)
f 2 6 7 3

# Front Face (v5, v8, v7, v6) - Note the ordering for correct normal
f 5 8 7 6

# Left Face (v1, v4, v8, v5)
f 1 4 8 5

# Top Face (v4, v3, v7, v8)
f 4 3 7 8

# Bottom Face (v1, v5, v6, v2)
f 1 5 6 2
