# Checks that the shared MuJoCo library exports only the C API that MuJoCo's
# headers declare with MJAPI (like CMake's libmujoco) plus the private
# _mjPRIVATE_* functions used by the Python bindings, so that engine internals
# and the bundled third-party libraries stay hidden; and that it exports every
# public function in introspect/functions.py (parsed from mujoco.h by clang).
#
# Usage: mujoco_shared_exports_test.sh [--exclude=REGEX] <exports> <functions_py> <header>...
#
# <exports> lists the library's exported symbols, one per line. <functions_py>
# is python/mujoco/introspect/functions.py. The headers are all of MuJoCo's
# headers. --exclude skips public function names matching REGEX that the
# library isn't expected to export.
